My Artist's Education

As some of may or may not know, starting in the Fall of 2015, I took a 10-month leave of absense. During my time away I went to Tuscany, Venice, Rome, Provence, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Rome, Bologna, back to Provence, Paris, Amsterdam (twice), and a number of other places along the way. I took dance lessons. I took painting lessons. I took cooking lessons. I wrote software. I did consulting work for OCLC. I was a sort of expert witness for a global legal firm. I gave more than a few professional lectures. I ate well, I drank well, and I fell in love at least once a week. It was a life-changing adventure, and I call the whole thing my Artist's Education.

Finally, this past week, I organized all of my photographs from the Education (a couple thousand of them), subdivided them into five books, and sent the images off to be professionally bound. The printers, along the way, created a set of flip books, and I'm sharing them with you, here:

  1. Tuscany, Venice, Rome, and Provence (http://m1lk.co/58k21fo)
  2. Mostly Chicago where I taught XML 101 (http://m1lk.co/2rom5y3m)
  3. Mostly Philadelphia where it snowed three feet (http://m1lk.co/x7oou8w)
  4. More Rome where I worked for the American Academy (http://m1lk.co/0yk9o45w)
  5. Even more Rome where I fell in love again, and again, and again (http://m1lk.co/auwb32)

It was a life-changing event, and it was exactly what a sabbatical was suppose to be like. I advocate we here in the libraries take more leaves-of-absense.
